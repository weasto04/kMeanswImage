# kMeanswImage

Simple frontend-only image segmentation demo using RGB k-means.

How to use

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or serve with a static server).
2. Upload an image.
3. Click "Plot RGB Cloud" to view the RGB scatter.
4. Choose `k` and click "Run K-Means" to segment the image.

Notes

- This is intentionally minimal and uses no front-end frameworks.
- The plot is a simple 3D rotation projection for visualization only.
